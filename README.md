# Java_SQL_Project

In this project I created a Java program that read the two files Person.data and Order.data. Afterwards the program had to populate two tables in MySQL using the information in these files. 

Then the program would carry out two different queries. The first one would search for every person in the Person Table that has at least on Order. The second would find all Orders with the First Name of the corresponding person. 

Hope that explains most of it.

Thank you.
